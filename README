EPUB to Website

Instructions:

Step 1: Unzip your EPUB (sorry, but writing that into this program was a bit too much for me).

Step 2: Name your site in the app.yaml file

Step 3: Go to /data/data.py and edit "BOOK_TITLE", "BOOK_SUBTITLE", "AUTHOR_NAME", and "AUTHOR_WEBSITE". If either subtitle or author's website are not relevant, set it to None or "".

Step 4: Place your package.opf file in the /package folder (it should be named package.opf).

Step 5: Place all your text .xhtml files (basic text content files) in /templates/text folder.

Step 6: Place your nav.xhtml file in the /templates/Navigation folder (it should be named nav.xhtml).

Step 7: Place your css file in BOTH /css and /css/css.

Step 8: Place all your images in the images folder (if you want unique error images, edit those in /images/error_images).

Step 9: Enjoy.
