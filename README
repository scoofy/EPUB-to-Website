EPUB to Website

Instructions:

Step 1: Create a Google App Engine account, download the appengine launcher, and add this folder as "an existing application."

Step 2: Unzip your EPUB (sorry, but writing that into this program was a bit too much for me).

Step 3: Name your site in the app.yaml file under "application:"

Step 4: Go to /data/data.py and enter "BOOK_TITLE", "BOOK_SUBTITLE", "AUTHOR_NAME", "AUTHOR_WEBSITE" and "EPUB_FILENAME". If either BOOK_SUBTITLE or AUTHOR_WEBSITE are not relevant, set it to None or "".

Step 5: Place your package.opf file in the /package folder (it should be named package.opf).

Step 6: Place all your text .xhtml files (basic text content files) in /templates/text folder.

Step 7: Place your nav.xhtml file in the /templates/Navigation folder (it should be named nav.xhtml).

Step 8: Place your epub's css file in BOTH /css and /css/css.

Step 9: Place all your images in the images folder (if you want unique error images, edit those in /images/error_images).

Step 10: Set your unique password in /do_not_copy/do_not_copy.py, ideally, this would be a hash.

Step 11: When you launch your website, navigate to "/upload" and upload your epub. If your upload is successful, follow the instructions by setting EPUB_UPLOADED to True and inputting the proper url for EPUB_FILE_URL. 

Step 12: Enjoy. There may some extra, required html editing in homepage.html, change the favicon.ico, etc., but everything else should be ready to go.
